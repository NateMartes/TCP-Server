# TCP-Server
Welcome to my TCP Echo Sever using TypeScript.

This server is a basic echo server, just waiting for a connection and once
a connection is made, will wait for messages.

# Running the Server

Nodejs and npm are both required to run this server.

Please run the following:
```npx tsx echoServer_v3.ts```
